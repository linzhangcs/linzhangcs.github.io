### Role: Front-End Developer [View Website](http://octannerjewelers.com)

This elegant website is developed using the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is a front-end only website, without any back-end components. We had a small development team, and I worked with two developers on this project who were off-site. I built the modules and templates. My favorite one is the [Bridal](http://octannerjewelers.com/bridal/) section.
Individual pages on this website are built using different templates and each template contains multiple modules.
