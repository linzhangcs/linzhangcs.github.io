### Role: Front-End Developer

For this website, we used a static site generator framework called Middleman. The framework runs on Ruby on Rails and it is great for building front-end focused websites. The biggest challenge for this project was to organize and represent the content in a meaningful and clear way, so that it is intuitive to navigate. Our solution offers clear information and visual hierarchy to users. The underlying development follows this hierarchy.
