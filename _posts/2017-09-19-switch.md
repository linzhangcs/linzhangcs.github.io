During our 2nd class, we learned about circuit and interesting ways to make a switch. For project, I want to repurpose an existing things that can be easily understood as a switch. I decided to make a zipper switch. It already being used as a way to open and close cloth or bags. It is intuitive for people to repurpose it as a switch. I found a metal zipper with plastic zipper teeth. I tried several ways to make the plastic zipper teeth conductive.

## Method One - copper tape:

Because the shop supplies copper tape. It would be an easy way to make a circuit. I put the copper tape inside of the bag and right underneath the zipper teeth, and have 2 stripes sticking out, so when I close the the zipper, the stripes will make contact and complete the circuit. The plan worked; however, it only works for a limited number of times and it’s not consist.
I see a problem with that approach and wanted a more reliable method.

## Method Two - conductive thread

The soft lab supplies conductive thread, and I thought it would give my zipper a consistent contact. I sew the conductive thread at the end of the zipper, so it would connect the circuit when zipped up. Unfortunately, after several tries, the thread is not give enough contact

## Method Three -  wire

After trying for a while and not getting a consistent contact, I asked for help and got the idea to connect the wire directly to the zipper. It’s the most consistent!
