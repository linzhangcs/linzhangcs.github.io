For this week's project, I wanted to make a wifi enabled RGB LED light as a part of larger project idea. Having a wifi enabled one will let me send a color to the LED through an API.

## Display Three colors

First of all, I want to understand how RGB LED light works. I made a sketch that switch to red, green and blue.

## Cycle Through colors

After having a better understanding of RGB LED light. I made a sketch that slowly transition from one color to another.

## Pass a RGB color to LED through firebase API

I want to pass a RGB color remotely through an API. I was able to do that after getting an arduino mk 1000.
