The inspiration of my multiples assignment is an illustration by Japanese artist Aoki Tetsuo. It is a woodblock print. The print depicts a line of people leaning forward. I want to translate the two dimensional print into a three dimensional object that still resembles the original print. I want the print to be more tangible, so I can rearrange the print in real life. And each placement of the object can convey a different meaning, I thought that is interesting and fun to explore.

## Making Process

Having my concept in mind, I got the material needed for the project. I wanted to practice using wood as a material, which is completely new to me. Luckily, I found a whole dumpster of wood and used some for this project.

First of all, the raw material was too thick, so I split it using the bandsaw. After that I printed out a picture of the print, and made a template of the silhouette. Using the template, I traced it on to the wood.

Because the human silhouette is curvy, I used scroll saw to cut it out. I planed the sections of the block, so it can be easily cut out.

Once all the pieces are cut out, I needed to drill holes on the silhouettes for the stand. I initially thought the doweling jig would be great for this. However, not with my irregular human silhouette. I used a table clamp to hold it still while drilling. Additional concern with drilling for me was the width of the dowel. It was close to the bottom width of the silhouette. I was concern if I could split the wood. After asking the shop staff, I started with much smaller bits and build it up to the actual size 3/16’’.
