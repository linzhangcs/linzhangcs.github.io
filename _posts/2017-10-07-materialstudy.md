The inspiration for this two material project is the kinetic ring made by South Korean artist [Dukno Yoon](http://art.ksu.edu/people/faculty/yoon.html).

## Making Process

Although Dukno made his ring using one type of metal, I want to see how different metal would look together. I got steel and brass wire, brass tubes, and feather.
