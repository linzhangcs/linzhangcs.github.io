Googlemancy is a portal to digital divination. It combines modern technologies with ancient religious rituals. When you enter the portal, it asks you to think of a question to ask. With that question in mind, you type your question into the portal, along with your date of birth and a deep bow as a form of prayer. Once you have prayed hard enough, your question will be send over to Google. Google will answer it with its deep wisdom in the form of a poem. You need to decipher its meaning for yourself.

### Why

The suffix -mancy means *divination by a specified means*, so Googlemancy means the belief in harness the magical forces of Google to produce prophecy. This project was inspired by Google's *I'm feeling lucky* option. It reminded me of [Bibliomancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliomancy), which is the practice of opening a sacred book to see an answer to a question.

In an age where we use Google to find answers to any questions popped into mind, we forgot or have never known life without its convenience. What do we trade for this convenience? Googlemancy explores the idea when Google search engine is no longer a friendly assistant, but a new religion.

### How

Googlemancy inconsist of two parts: a website and a wearable prayer device. The website was built using Javascript - retrieve data, parse website source code, and generate poem. The website introduction content was from [Church of Google's prayer section](http://churchofgoogle.org/google_prayers.html).   

The prayer device was built with Arduino MRK1000, mini vibration motor, gyroscope, resistors, and wires soldered onto a protoboard, and sew onto a stretchy harness.

Here is more info on the [making process](https://linzhangcs.github.io/blog//2018/05/08/googlemancywearable/).

### Exhibition

Googlemancly was installed at [New York Hall of Science](https://nysci.org/) as part of [World Maker Faire New York 2018](https://makerfaire.com/new-york/).

There were different reactions to this project. Some people were intrigued; some were weird out. Some people started a long discussion with friends on the spot. Also it was interesting to see everyone defaults a way of praying - seeing someone kneeled down in front of a computer was something indescribable.
