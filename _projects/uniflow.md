uniFlow is a Unity plugin for Dialogflow v2. It enables creators to integrate natural language conversation into AR and VR environments.
This project was selected and funded by [xStory](https://www.itpxstory.com/), and will be continued throughout 2019.

### Why

While learning to use Oculus Rift and developing AR / VR games, I realized XR has too much barrier for someone who is new to the experience. Especially in VR, I found myself wishing I could simply talk to make things happen, so I am not feeling overwhelmed. I looked into different way of integrating voice into Unity, and found [Api.ai: Unity Plugin](https://github.com/dialogflow/dialogflow-unity-client). It was easy to use, but it was going to be deprecated. We made uniFlow as a continuation of Api.ai.
