In our modern work environment, knowledge-based professionals not only need to have the skill to perform complicated tasks and goals, they also need to learn how to navigate and negotiate creative differences with their co-workers, supervisors, and clients.

Unwind is a set of voice-controlled exercises that help working professionals to better understand others and resolve conflicts in collaborative work environment

### Why

My motivation for this project comes from moments in my professional life, where I wish I was better prepared. During those difficult times, I looked for any media content - books, workshop, etc that reflected on similar situation. They helped me to understand, improve, and heal. I wonder if I would have felt and done better if I had access to good advice or tools. Although knowing how to having difficult conversations is a skill that affects our day-to-day life, it is a skill we are expected to learn as we get older. It is not taught in school. When it is being directly address, they are often set in professional business context - business books and seminars. There is a need for having an accessible way to learn how to address those confusing situations.

### How
To understand how to resolve conflicts, I spoke at length with professional mediator, Colleen M Maeder. Once I had a sense the process, I prototyped and user tested it.

Unwind is built with Dialogflow, Actions on Google, and Google Assistant. The conversation design follows this flowchart:
