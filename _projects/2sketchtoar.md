Sketch to AR is an interactive experience that let you see your sketches in a new way - translated into 3D objects in augmented reality.

When you open Sketch to AR, it asks you to draw something. You are free to draw whatever that comes to your mind. Once you have a sketch, show it to Sketch to AR. You will see your drawing translated into a 3D object in AR.

### Why

Games like Pictionary and more recent AI version [Quick, Draw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) are popular, because they tap into our need to communicate, in a visual way. That is why we watch other people play [Pictionary](https://youtu.be/97xL-DNDHEI) on the internet & TV. This experience explores how human collaborates with machines to perform this activity.

### How

Sketch to AR was built using ARKit in Unity. It used Google [Vision AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/#industry-leading-accuracy-for-image-understanding) for identifying the sketches, and Google [Poly API](https://developers.google.com/poly/develop/) for querying and loading 3D objects into the AR scene.
Here is more info on the [making process](https://linzhangcs.github.io/blog//2018/10/31/sketchTo3D/) if you are interested.

### Exhibition

Sketch to AR was selected for ITP/IMA Spring Show 2019. Over 200 people tried it over a period of two days, 8 hours in total. Out those 200 people, some are curious kids with their parents, students and professionals in the creative fields, some are developers who worked on Poly API. We even had Professor Clay Shirky and the NYU president Andrew D. Hamilton trying it out.
