SeeSaw is an interactive game that brings users a collaborative experience. It combines two popular games, seesaw and brick breaker, with the big seesaw as the controller.

The experience works like this: two players go up and down on the physical seesaw to move the paddle in the brick breaker game. It is simple, but hard to play. Why? Because playing seesaw is about moving freely, and it is hard to move freely and move the paddle with the accuracy it needs to bounce the ball. It is a combination of carefree play and focused mastery.

### Why

The aim of this game is to remind people the importance of play. My collaborator and I noticed as we get older, our families, friends, and even ourselves demand achievements and skills from us, so our lives are driven by the need to acquiring skills and achieving goals. Doing those things are important, and so is making the journey fun and joyful.

### How

SeeSaw's controller is built with lumber cut using bandsaw and CNC, joined by bolts and nuts, ball bearings, dowels, and screws. It gets pressure data from the seats and angle data from a Adafruit 9-DOF IMU Breakout board, and sends data through a micro USB cable to an Arduino.
