<p>See_._Saw is an interactive game brings people a collaborative experience in two familiar childhood games: seesaw and brick breaker. The paddle in the brick breaker game moves based on the tilting direction of the seesaw. When it tilts down in one direction, the paddle will move along with the seesaw to that direction. The goal of combining the two games is to allow adults re-visit the fun experience of playing seesaw with a clear objective. Although games often are competitive, this is a game only can be play if both of the players are collaborative and moving together.</p>

<p><em>Why build a seesaw? Canâ€™t we buy one?</em></p>

<p>The intended audience is adults. We searched for seesaw for adults with no results on the major online retailers: Amazon, Aliexpress, and Google shopping. The ones we can find are designed for kids from age 4 to 8. To ensure a safe and fun experience, we built a seesaw that is measured and designed according to the body size of adults.</p>
